    Use this image to create a dramatic portrait of me, sitting confidently on a wooden stool against a dark studio background. He's wearing a well-fitting black suit, with a black shirt and pants, a small naki-colored silver chain, and a small silver watch slightly unbuttoned at the top, exuding a melancholic yet powerful aura. His posture is relaxed yet commanding, with one arm resting on his leg and the other in his pants pocket. The lighting is soft yet directional.

    Keep the real face in the image. I want my photo to look like the one described above.
